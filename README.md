## CSV Parse

#### CSV Data

- This repo contains a data directory with a CSV file you can use to complete this challenge.

#### The Challenge

- Take the supplied CSV file and convert the data into an array of objects that can be saved in MongoDB.
- Start with a basic JavaScript file (no libraries or frameworks).
- Create a function that will convert the CSV formatted data into an array of objects (Note: the first row of data in a CSV file usually contains the 'keys').
- Use console.log() to verify your results.
- Your array of objects should express the exact same information as the original CSV.
- Once you verify your results, save the data in MongoDB.


##### Stretch Goals

- Convert your script file into a Node/Express server.
- Create a route to display the saved data in a table.
- Add another route that will allow a user to upload the CSV file and process it using the CSV parse function you created.

##### Hungry For More?

- Create a "Show" route that will allow the user to view details for each record.
- Create Update and Delete routes.
